|vim-pandoc| provides facilities to integrate Vim with the |pandoc| document
converter and work with documents written in |pandocs-markdown-variant|
variant (although textile documents are also supported). It is the main item
in |vim-pandoc-project|.

REQUIREMENTS			                      *vim-pandoc-requirements*
 
* Vim 7.4
  Note: On vim versions < 7.4, some modules are automatically disabled (see
  |g:pandoc#modules#disabled|, but vim-vim-pandoc is able to run in a degraded
  mode.
* python support.
  Note: If python is not available, the features that require it are
  automatically disabled, allowing vim-pandoc to run in a degraded mode.
  However, vim-pandoc uses the new python API, so in versions under 7.4,
  even if python is available, some functions might not.

To check if the requirements are satisfied, check if

    :echo v:version >= 704 && has("python")

outputs "1".

INSTALLATION                                          *vim-pandoc-installation*

The plugin follows the usual bundle structure, so it's easy to install it
using pathogen, Vundle or NeoBundle.

The most recent version is available at github. For those who need it, a
tarball is available from here.

- Using Vundle (recommended)

  Just add

    Plugin 'vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc'

  to your ~/.vimrc file and run :PluginInstall

NeoBundle users should replace `Plugin` in these instructions with
`NeoBundle`.

- Using Pathogen

    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone git@github.com:vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc.git

- The repo is pathogen compatible and you can also just drop it in runtimepath.

SYNTAX                                            *vim-pandoc-pandoc-syntax*

vim-pandoc doesn't provide a syntax file for pandoc markdown files. Please
use https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax for this:

   Plugin 'vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax'

Note: this syntax file is used for both `markdown` and `pandoc` filetypes by
default, but you can opt out of it for markdown files by setting
|g:pandoc#filetypes#pandoc_markdown| to 0.

The reason we split the syntax file is it is much cleaner to track issues
separatedly. It also allows users not to use this syntax file if they want to
(notice that vim-pandoc-syntax is also configurable).

FILETYPES					          *vim-pandoc-filetypes*

vim-pandoc is not a regular filetype plugin. Although it does define a
`pandoc` filetype, vim-pandoc can also attach to other filestypes, like
`markdown`, `rst` and `textile`. In that case, vim-pandoc uses the
appropiate filetype syntax file, but creates the Pandoc command and loads the
extra utilities. What filetypes to attach to is determined by the value of the
|g:pandoc#filetypes#handled| variable.

Setting `pandoc#filetypes#pandoc_markdown` to 0 will disable all pandoc
functionality for markdown files, unless "pandoc" exists in the
`pandoc#filetypes#handled` array.

To enable pandoc functionality for markdown files while using  the markdown
filetype and syntax, use
>
     let g:pandoc#filetypes#handled = ["pandoc", "markdown"]
     let g:pandoc#filetypes#pandoc_markdown = 0

Note: vim-pandoc's developers mostly use pandoc's markdown syntax, so
coverage for it is more complete than for the other filetypes.

MODULES                                                     *vim-pandoc-modules*

vim-pandoc is split in several modules. They can be enabled and disabled
independently at startup, by adjusting the values of the
|g:pandoc#modules#enabled| and |g:pandoc#modules#disabled| variables. 

For example, some people prefer not to use folds, so they would want to
disable the `folding` module, which creates folds for headers and some special
cases. To disable the module they should put

    let g:pandoc#modules#disabled = ["folding"]

in their .vimrc.

                                                       *vim-pandoc-modules-list*

Now, a description of the available modules

- FORMATTING                                      *vim-pandoc-formatting-module*

Handles basic writing settings, like the use of hard or soft line wraps. It is
recommended to leave this module enabled.

The module behavior is configured through the |g:pandoc#formatting#mode|
variable. For example, giving it the value 'ha' will enable hard breaks, and
autoformatting. The default is to use soft wraps.

If you use the hard wraps mode, you could want to adjust the textwidth value.
This can be done through the |g:pandoc#formatting#textwidth| variable, or
setting |textwidth| by hand.

A smart auto-formatting mode is provided, intended to use with the hard
wrapping mode. When enabled, (using the 'A' flag for
|g:pandoc#formatting#mode|), the plugin will be aware of what sort of block
the cursor is in and adjust |formatoptions| accordingly (so, for example,
headers won't be broken when they go beyond |textwidth|, and no autoformatting
will be used within codeblocks). Note this functionality requires the
|vim-pandoc-syntax| plugin to be installed, because it uses highlighting
information to work. By default, this kind of autoformatting is triggered on
entering and leaving insert mode, but it can be triggered when the cursor
moves in insert mode too if desired (it can be cleaner, although it might add
some lag), by setting |g:pandoc#formatting#smart_autoformat_on_cursormoved|.
The user can temporarily disable/enable this autoformatting feature on any
specific buffer by setting the value of *b:pandoc_autoformat_enabled* (which
can be done using the `pandoc#formatting#{Enable,Disable,Toggle}Autoformat()`
functions).

The formatting module also configures the program used for the |=| command,
which you can use to reformat your document (by default: wraps lines, returns
inline links and footnotes into reference links, etc.). This is configured
with the |g:pandoc#formatting#equalprg| and
|g:pandoc#formatting#extra_equalprg| variables. Please note that if you pass a
whole file through the default filter, it might delete some stuff, like LaTeX
macro definitions and title blocks. 

- FOLDING                                            *vim-pandoc-folding-module*

Provides folding support for markdown and textile files.

The initial |'foldlevel'| is set with |g:pandoc#folding#level|. By default,
vim-pandoc will enable the |foldcolumn| with a width of 1. This can be
configured with the |g:pandoc#folding#fdc| variable.

As expected, folds are created for headers in markdown and textile files. The
folding level for the headers can be defined by two methods, configurable with
|g:pandoc#folding#mode|. The default mode, "syntax", uses the header syntax to
determine the level. So

    ### this is level 3
    #### this is level 4
    ###### this is level 6
    #### this is level 4
    # this is level 1

The "relative" mode counts the number of parents the header has, so

    ### this is level 1
    #### this is level 2
    ###### this is level 3
    #### this is level 2
    # this is level 1

The "stacked" mode counts all headers as first level, and it can be used to
view all the headers at once.

The mode can be changed on the fly using the *:PandocFolding* command.

Besides this, some extensions are provided:

* If present, fold the document's YAML frontmatter (this is configurable with
  |g:pandoc#folding#fold_yaml|)
* Fold divs of the classes defined in |g:pandoc#folding#fold_div_classes|. For
  example, you might want to create notes for a presentation. pandoc
  understands

    <div class="notes">
    this is an observation
    </div foldend>

  is a note and will suppress it from the slides. Now, you might want to hide
  those while preparing the slides, and that's where this feature comes in
  handy (the `folding` module folds divs of the `notes` class by default, you
  can disable that clearing g:pandoc#folding#fold_div_classes).
  Note: You must add the `foldend` attribute to the closing `div` tag,
  otherwise the folding levels can get messed up.
* Fold in custom marked comments. For example, this will fold

    <!-- Custom fold fold-begin -->
    blah blah blah...
    <!-- fold-end -->

  Note: This also works in textile files, with `.. fold-begin` and `..
  fold-end`.
* Fold emulating vim's marker folding method (see 'foldmethod'). By default,
  this will only  work for marks within comments (see
  |g:pandoc#folding#markers_in_comments_only|).  For example,

  <!-- {{{3 -->
  this is a marked fold
  <!-- }}} -->

* Fold fenced codeblocks. By default, this is disabled, but can be turned on
  by setting |g:pandoc#folding#fold_fenced_codeblocks| to 1.

NOTE: when using split windows, the foldexpr function can get called many more
times than usual, so in this case the folding function is disabled for
performance reasons.

- COMMAND                                            *vim-pandoc-command-module*

Note: This modules requires python support.

The `command` module sets up a buffer-local *:Pandoc* command which handles
pandoc execution. This command builds an incantation for pandoc using
vim-pandocs configuration and the current state of the buffer
(bibliographies found, etc.).

The syntax of the :Pandoc command is as follows:

    :Pandoc[!] OUTPUT-FORMAT ARGS

Where OUTPUT-FORMAT is the value you would normally pass to the -t option in
pandoc, and ARGS are auxiliary arguments you want to pass pandoc. For example,

    :Pandoc beamer -Vlang:spanish

will create an incantation like:
    
    pandoc -t beamer -Vlang:spanish -o file.pdf file.pdc

:Pandoc will also use the value of |b:pandoc_biblio_bibs| to pass
`--bibliography` arguments, so the user shouldn't do that himself.

Once pandoc runs, depending on the value of
|g:pandoc#command#use_message_buffers| and if some error occurred, a buffer
will open displaying the command output. You can dismiss this buffer pressing
'q'. Regardless of pandoc's execution status, the invocation used will be logged so
it can be checked using |:messages|.

If you write a bang ('!') after the command, vim-pandoc will try to open
the created file in its associated program. This behavior can be customized
through the |g:pandoc#command#custom_open| variable. 

Note: The pandoc execution is performed asynchronously if vim supports the
|clientserver| feature and the running instance is a valid server (this is the
default for gvim, but must be made explicit when running in a terminal, see
|x11-clientserver|). This feature also requires python to be available in the
system. 

The :Pandoc command has argument completion for supported output formats and
pandoc option arguments.

Note: Previously, vim-pandoc used the executors system present in
vim-pandoc, which allowed for the execution of command pipelines. This is no
longer supported. If you want to pass the file through a filter, use pandoc's
-F option.

As a convenience, you can have vim-pandoc auto execute pandoc on writes. To
enable this functionality, set |g:pandoc#command#autoexec_on_writes| to 1 and
provide a command to execute like so:

    let |g:pandoc#command#autoexec_command| = "Pandoc! pdf"

You can also use a buffer local variable if you want to override the global
setting.

    let |b:pandoc_command_autoexec_command| = "Pandoc! html"

-- TEMPLATES                                       *vim-pandoc-command-templates*

It might get tedious to reuse the same arguments over and over. For example,
the user might frequently execute

    :Pandoc! pdf -Vdocumentclass=memoir -Vdocumentclassoptions=article -Vmainfont='GFS Bodoni'

He can save this incantation as a 'template', so later he could simply run

    :Pandoc! #my_usual_article

Note: templates don't record if a bang was used for the Pandoc command, so once
#my_usual_article is defined, both ':Pandoc #my_usual_article' and ':Pandoc!
#my_usual_article' are possible.

                                                                *:PandocTemplate*
To save the latest :Pandoc incantation as a template, the user should execute

    :PandocTemplate save my_usual_article

It is also possible to save a custom incantation like this

    :PandocTemplate save fancy_article pdf -Vdocumentclass=memoir -Vmainfont='Helvetica Neue'

To review some template, use

    :PandocTemplate get my_usual_article

which should output the template definition.

- MENU                                                   *vim-pandoc-menu-module*

Creates a menu for pandoc handled files. If the `command` module is enabled,
you can build your documents from it.

- KEYBOARD                                           *vim-pandoc-keyboard-module*

Registers custom mappings for applying text styles, navigating the documents
and more. To keep things neat, this module loads mappings from submodules.
|g:pandoc#keyboard#enabled_submodules| determines which of those are enabled.
The default mappings can be disabled as a whole setting
|g:pandoc#keyboard#use_default_mappings| to 0. The mappings for individual
modules can be disabled using |g:pandoc#keyboard#blacklist_submodule_mappings|.

This is list of the mappings currently implemented (in brackets, the modes
where they are available):

- *<localleader>i*     toggles emphasis [vn]
- *<localleader>b*     toggles bold [vn]
- *<localleader>`*     toggles verbatim [vn]
- *<localleader>~~*    toggles strikeout [vn]
- *<localleader>^*     toggles superscript [vn]
- *<localleader>_*     toggles subscript [vn]
- *<localleader>#*     apply header (accepts a count) [n]
- *<localleader>hd*    remove header [n]
- *<localleader>hn*    move to next header [n]
- *<localleader>hb*    move to previous header [n]
- *<localleader>hh*    go to current header [n]
- *<localleader>hp*    go to current header's parent [n]
- *<localleader>hsn*   move to next sibling header [n]
- *<localleader>hsb*   move to previous sibling header [n]
- *<localleader>hcf*   move fo first child header [n]
- *<localleader>hcl*   move to last child header [n]
- *<localleader>hcn*   move to [count] nth child header [n]
- ]]                 [count] sections forward (like <localleader>hn) [n]
- [[                 [count] sections backwards [n]
- ][                 [count] move to the next section end [n]
- []                 [count] move to the previous section end [n]
- aS                 select a section, including header [vo]
- iS                 select a section, excluding header [vo]
- *<localleader>nr*    insert a ref definition after this paragraph [n]
- *<localleader>rg*    go to reference definition [n]
- *<localleader>rb*    go back to reference label [n]
- *<localleader>gl*    go to current link
- *<localleader>gb*    go back from link (just for internal header links)
- *<localleader>ln*    move to next list item [n]
- *<localleader>lp*    move to previous list item [n]
- *<localleader>ll*    move to the current list item [n]
- *<localleader>llp*   move to parent of the current list item [n]
- *<localleader>lsn*   move to the next list item sibling [n]
- *<localleader>lsp*   move to the previous list item sibling [n]
- *<localleader>lcf*   move to the first list item child [n]
- *<localleader>lcl*   move to the last list item child [n]
- *<localleader>lcn*   move to the [count] nth list item child [n]

For |<localleader>#|, you can decide what header style to use (always atx, use
setex, append hashes at the end) by setting the
|g:pandoc#keyboard#sections#header_style| variable.

Some of the reference-related mappings use |mark-motions|. You can configure
what mark to use by setting the value of |g:pandoc#keyboard#references#mark|,
in case the default ("r") is not suitable or needs to serve a different
purpose.

- BIBLIOGRAPHIES                               *vim-pandoc-bibliographies-module*

Note: This module requires python support.

Provides with support for bibliographic info completion and retrieval, and
also populates the |b:pandoc_biblio_bibs| variable, which the |:Pandoc|
command uses to build up the pandoc incantation.

vim-pandoc can handle BibTeX, RIS, MODS and JSON bibliographies.

The way the module populates the b:pandoc_biblio_bibs variable is determined
by the value of the |g:pandoc#biblio#sources| variable. Depending on it, the
module will gather bibliographies on the following order (between brackets,
the corresponding flag to give g:pandoc#biblio#sources):

1) [b] Search for any bibliography that shares the name of the current file in the 
   current directory.
   So, if the document is named `paper.mkd`, it will look for `paper.bib`,
   `paper.ris`, and so on.
2) [c] Search for any bibliography in the current dir.
3) [l] Search for default bibliographies (`default.bib`, `default.ris`, etc.) in pandoc's 
    data dir ("$HOME/.pandoc/" in *nix, "%APPDATA%/pandoc/" in Windows)
4) [t] Search for bibliographies in texmf (requires the `kpsewhich` program)
5) [g] Add any bibliographies listed in |g:pandoc#biblio#bibs|.

The default flags are "bcg". For the 'c' and 'l' flags, the
|g:pandoc#bibliographies#bib_extensions| is taken into account. You can, of
course, modify the value of |b:pandoc_biblio_bibs| at any time.

The `bibliographies` module also provides the functions that allow the
`completion` module to give suggestions for citation keys (see below). 

By default, this will only return matches for citekeys, but it is possible to
retrieve suggestions that match in any key by using the bibtool program. So,
if you are matching from

    @armstrong

you might retrieve both

    @armstrong1989    Armstrong, David M. - A Combinatorial Theory of Possibility
    @lewis1992        Lewis, David - Armstrong on Combinatorial Possibility

This is off by default, but can be turned on (if `bibtool` is available) by
setting the |g:pandoc#biblio#use_bibtool| variable to 1.


- COMPLETION                                       *vim-pandoc-completion-module*

Provides |omni-completion|. If the `bibliographies` module is active, it will
complete bibliographic references from the bibliography sources defined in
|g:pandoc#biblio#sources|.

The bibliographic completion has two backends, selected with the
|g:pandoc#completion#bib#mode| variable, 'fallback' and 'citeproc'. 'fallback'
uses internal information extractors for bibtex, ris and json bibliographies,
and 'citeproc' uses pandoc-citeproc for additional bibliography database types
and extra features. The 'citeproc' backend is experimental for now, but it is
planned to become the default in the future.

To use completion, start typing a citekey, e.g.,

    @geac

and then, while still in insert mode, hit CTRL-X CTRL-O (vim's shortcut
for |omni-completion|), and you'll get a popup window with a list of
matching keys, e.g.,

    @geach1970   Geach, P. T. – Entailment
    @geach1972   Geach, P. T. – Logic Matters

Regular expressions work too:

    @le.*90

should suggest both '@leftow1990' and '@lewis1990', assuming those are
both keys in your bibliography.

Tip: If you only want to complete from a list of citations, you could
create a file (let's say, `citations.dict`) that contains such a list, one
item at a time:

    @adams1967a
    @adams1971
    @adams1972a
    @adams1974
    @adams1977
    @adams1986a

and then add it to vim's |`dictionary`|, like so

    setlocal dictionary="citations.dict"

Then, you can complete from this list by pressing CTRL-X CTRL-K.

If the 'citeproc' backend is used, extra information can be displayed in the
preview window, depending on the value of
|g:pandoc#completion#bib#use_preview|.

- TOC                                                     *vim-pandoc-toc-module*

Provides the *:TOC* command, which displays a table of contents for the
current file using vim's location list system. The position of the TOC window
is configured by the |g:pandoc#toc#position| variable.

When the user presses <CR> (the Enter key) in the TOC buffer, the cursor is
moved in the source window to the position selected. By default, the TOC
buffer is closed after this, but this can be circumvented by pressing <C-CR>.
This behavior can be reversed by setting |g:pandoc#toc#close_after_navigating|
to 0.

- CHDIR                                                *vim-pandoc-chdir-module*

Changes the current window directory to the one the file is in
("%:h"). Enabled by default.

- SPELL                                                *vim-pandoc-spell-module*

Sets up spelling for files handled by vim-pandoc. Spelling is on by default,
but can be changed with the |g:pandoc#spell#enabled| variable. The user can
also specify what languages to use by default with the
|g:pandoc#spell#default_langs| variable.

- HYPERTEXT                                        *vim-pandoc-hypertext-module*

Adds some basic hypertext functions. Files and addresses can be opened in
system defined applications by pressing `gx`, or within vim, if possible, by
pressing `gf`.

Let's suppose you are editing the file "notes.md" with the contents:

     #) [important thing to do](important.html)
     #) [another thing to do](another.html)

and the files "important.md" and "another.md" are available. Pressing `gf`
over "important.html" will open "important.md" within the current vim instance
(this behavior of opening alternate files can be disabled by setting
|g:pandoc#hypertext#open_editable_alternates| to 0). `gx` would open
"important.html" in the browser, if the file existed.

See ||g:pandoc#hypertext#open_cmd| and |g:pandoc#hypertext#preferred_alternate| for
info on how to configure this modules's behavior.

There's an addition keyboard shortcut for following the link at cursor,
support `automatic link`, `inline link`, `reference link` and `images`. When
you press the shortcut, it will try to get the link address at cursor, and
then open it by VIM or system application. If the link address starts with a
`#`, then it will be treated as an header ID, and then will try to move the
cursor to specified header.
After moving, you can use |<localleader>gb| to move back to that link.

See |vim-pandoc-keyboard-module| ro detail.

SETTINGS                                                   *vim-pandoc-settings*

Module configuration variables defaults are initialized when the modules
themselves are initialized. This is so the global variable scope is not
cluttered with unused variables for users who have disabled some modules.

A description of the available configuration variables follows:

- *g:pandoc#filetypes#handled*
  default = ["markdown", "rst", "textile"]

  A list of the kinds of files vim-pandoc will attach to. 'extra' includes
  .text and .txt files. For what values are valid here, see the
  pandoc_extensions_table variable in plugin/pandoc.vim

- *g:pandoc#filetypes#pandoc_markdown*
  Default = 1

  Should we set the pandoc filetype (and load vim-pandoc-syntax) for common
  markdown extensions (*.md, *.mkd, etc)? Since regular markdown and pandoc's
  markdown variant differ, someone might want to restrict those extensions to
  regular markdown. In that case, we use vim's default syntax highlighting for
  markdown.

- *g:pandoc#modules#enabled* 

  default = ["formatting", "folding", "bibliographies", "completion",
  "metadata", "menu", "executors", "keyboard", "toc", "chdir", "spell", "hypertext"]

  A list of the modules to enable on the files determined by
  |g:pandoc#filetypes#handled|. See |vim-pandoc-modules|.

- *g:pandoc#modules#disabled*

  default = [], (["bibliographies", "command"] in vim < 7.4)

  Auxiliary module blacklist.

- *g:pandoc#formatting#mode*
  default = "s"
